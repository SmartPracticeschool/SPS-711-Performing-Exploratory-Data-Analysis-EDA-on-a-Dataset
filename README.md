Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Dataset

## Objectives : 

In this we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

1. Produce data visualizations with Seaborn, Matplotlib. 

2. Apply graphical techniques used in exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Structure :

### Task 1: Importing the Modules and Dataset

* We will import essential libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Seaborn, and matplotlib.

* We use pandas to load the Attrition Data Set.

### Task 2: Inspect Data

* We will use various pandas, numpy methods to inspect Data like : data.describe(), data.info() etc

* We will also generate descriptive statistics about the features that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of the data set's distribution.

### Task 3: Visualization

* We will use Matplotlib histogram to view the distribution of data

* We will use Seaborn's distplot(), boxplot()  method to visualize the Shape of data and outliers .

* Box plots are especially useful in identifying outliers in the data.

### Task 4: Analysis of Data

* Using Seaborn's piechart , boxplot(), countplot() analyse each column with respect to Attrition

### Task 5: Observing all Pairwise Correlations

* A good way to identify correlations between features is to visualize the correlation matrix as a heatmap. ( Seaborn's heatmap() )
